# Simple K-Nearest Neighbor

Assignment for data science course :)

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pandas and sklearn

```bash
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install sklearn
```

## Usage

Once installed, route into the directory and run the command

```bash
python3 a1.py
```

From here a REPL command prompt will display in the terminal. From here you can input custom field values for each dimension.

```
Welcome to the iris.csv K-NN model! Please follow the instructions to
input data to predict upon... Enter '!DONE' to exit.
   sepal.length  sepal.width  petal.length  petal.width  variety
0           5.1          3.5           1.4          0.2        1

4           5.0          3.6           1.4          0.2        1
Accuracy: 0.9777777777777777
Enter value for Sepal length: 7.2
Enter value for Sepal width: 3.0
Enter value for Petal length: 6.3
Enter value for Petal width: 1.8
The model predicts that the data you entered is of variety Virginica
Enter value for Sepal length: !DONE
```

## Learning Outcomes

- Refresher on pandas/sklearn and python
